Welcome to the Temperature Converter repository! This project is a Java-based GUI application that simplifies temperature conversions between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin scales. With this program, users can easily input a temperature value and its original unit of measurement, and then witness the conversion to the other two units in real-time.
